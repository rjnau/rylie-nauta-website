			<h><b>CHARACTER DESIGN</b></h>
	<br>
	<p>For our character design task, we had the complete freedom of inventing a character from scratch (preferrably a character for a game). After creating a mindmap and brainstorming ideas that I liked, I chose to create a nonbinary hunter/assassin. Here you'll find a quick overview of my process, as well as screenshots and a PDF folio of my work!  </p>

	<img src="images/animationIMG/5 silhouettes.jpg" alt="a refined and more detailed 5 silhouette poses">
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<p> <b>Silhouette Sketches:</b> To help me get a feel of the character, as well as explore different possible poses I could draw my character in, I experimented by drawing 20 different silhouette poses. I then chose 5 of my favourites and refined them.  </p>
	<img src="images/animationIMG/rough sketch character.jpeg" alt="a detailedv and annotated drawing of Artemis in a fighting stance with a spear in hand" style="height:650px;">
	<p><b>Detailed Pose:</b> Choosing one of my 5 final silhouette drawings, I drew Artemis for the first time! This was just a sketch to get the pose downpat, but it also helped to add detail and get a clear idea of what I wanted Artemis to look like.  </p>
	<br>
	<img src="images/animationIMG/artemis drawing.png" alt="a black and white orthographic digital lineart of Artemis">
	<p><b>Orthographic:</b> An orthographic drawing is when you draw a character from the front view and side view/back view (some people draw front and side, others draw front and back). This helpes designers to understand the exact details of the clothing and appearance of the character.  </p>

	<img src="images/animationIMG/split complementary artemis.PNG" alt="a coloured in version of the Artemis orthographic">
	<p><b>Colour Pallettes:</b> I was required to show a demonstration of different colour pallettes for Artemis, consisting of split complimentary, complimentary, and triad colours. </p>

	<img src="images/animationIMG/artemis final colours.PNG" alt="a finished coloured digital drawing of Artemis" style="height:550px;">
	<p><b>Final Colours:</b> After experimenting with different colours, I decided on this as the final colours for Artemis. The colours represented their adventures in the game, and how they grew up in the jungle/forest. </p>

	<img src="images/animationIMG/artemis final poster.png" alt="a finished poster with a fully coloured digital drawing of Artemis with the games title (Artemis) above them" style="height:700px;">
	<p><b>Final Poster:</b> This is my final character design poster! I took the front final coloured orthographic and put it in front of a lightened grey background with the characters name at the top. </p>

		<h><b>Artemis Synposis</b></h>
		<p>Set in an alternate universe filled with ancient creatures of the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods of the Mesozoic era, you play as a huntress named Artemis. The Earth is split into 3 large continents; Triassica, Jurassica and Cretaceia, each filled with the animals from each Mesozoic period. The player, or Artemis, begins their journey in the Triassic continent, Triassica, where their tribe has been wiped out by a strange and dangerous creature which had disappeared just as mysteriously as it had appeared. Artemis must complete quests and rebuild civilisation with an ambitious amount of side quests and main quests. Collect resources, craft tools, befriend tribes, tame creatures, build villages, discover landmarks, gather resources, escape angry tribes; Artemis’ adventures are endless.
</p>
		<br>
		<h><b>Behind The Scenes</b></h>
						<p>Artemis began with the design of the protagonist, Artemis. From there, a world and story behind Artemis just came to life; I thought, ‘How cool would it be if people got to experience Artemis’ adventure themselves?’. <br>After working on the design of the character, the world, the enemies, and all the inner workings of the story and narrative, my team and I began working on the practical of the game. Where would the player begin? Would there be cut-scenes? What would the first quests be? What assets do we need to start work on? <br>Beginning the asset design and models were quite easy, it was putting them all together in a game format that was actually playable that was hard. We used Maya to model, and Unreal Engine 4 to build the environment of the game itself. 
</p>
		<br>
						<h><b>Art Style</b></h>
						<p>The style behind Artemis took great inspiration from the Legend of Zelda series games (more specifically, Breath of the Wild and Skyward Sword). The designs and models are realistic yet simplistic, a mixture of cartoonistic and lifelike appearances. This not only provided the game with a comfortable look and feel, it made the modelling and texturing process much easier. </p>
		<br>
			<h><b>Time and Budget</b></h>
			<p>The ideas and planning process lasted just under two months. It seems like a while, but I had the job of designing and planning the characters, environment, story and plot, style of the game, enemies the player would face, working out finances and timelines of work.<br>After this process, the REAL work for everything practical with the game took my team and I around a year and a half (this was for the planning and creation of assets and extra 3D models). The following year and a half after was spent putting our game world together and working on programming, with another few months after spent working on gathering music, sound effects, voice acting --pretty much all of the audio-- and putting that into the game. The games overall budget was $500,000.<br>
Finally, after a long lasting amount of work and effort, Artemis is set to available for purchase on October 19, 2021 on Steam, Xbox and PlayStation.

						<ul>
						<li>Current Occupation:</li>
							<p>Student</p>
						<li>History of my work in digital media:</li>
							<p>The recent digital media projects that I’ve created and polished off at Assumption College are a 3D modelled game asset (a pair of steampunk goggles) and a game environment (an awesome medieval themed bedroom), designing and coding a website completely from scratch, designing and drawing a game character in my own style, and finally doing some 2D animation and making my own game trailer.</p>
						<li>Skills:</li>
							<p>I’ve worked on all my projects (personal and school-related) using Autodesk Maya, Unreal Engine 4, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Animate, and Adobe After Effects</p>
						<li>What got me interested in digital media:</li>
							<p>I’ve had an interest in drawing and creating things for about as long as I can remember, and I’ve only grown more interested as I’ve gotten older. And thanks to being in school where there are courses and classes that peak this interest, I’ve found myself drawn to digital media as a whole. Things that continously inspire me and keep me invested in digital media is probably indie games and also digital artists that I follow online.</p>
						<li>My favourite video game / animation / studio:</li>
							<p>My favourite game studio is Blizzard Entertainment. The games they’ve created over time that have gotten a lot of fan-love is admiring, and I’m a big fan their animations released on YouTube that explore more of the characters and game lores. My favourite individual game developer, however,  is either Toby Fox or Scott Cawthorn; two guys who created their own games from scratch, quite inspiring if you ask me. </p>
						<li>Favourite hobbies:</li>
							<p>By far drawing and creating characters, writing my own stories and narratives, playing video games (of course), reading online novels and comics

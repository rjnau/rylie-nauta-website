			<h><b>3D MODELLED GAME ASSET</b></h>
<p>My first 3D modelling task was to create a game asset (an object) in Autodesk Maya and texture it. I chose to create a pair of steampunk goggles.</p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<img src="images/3d modelling/references.PNG">
	<br>
	<p> <b>Inspiration/References:</b> To help me with ideas, I collected a couple images which inspired me and gave me more of an idea of how I wanted my goggles to look.  </p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<img src="images/3d modelling/gogglesketch1.PNG">
	<img src="images/3d modelling/gogglesketch2.PNG">
	<p> <b>Concept Sketches:</b> I drew three sketches of goggles, each with their own unique details. This kinda helped me just to figure out how I wanted them to look, and also put into consideration that texturing would be difficult if i had heaps of little details. In the end I chose sketch #3 to make.  </p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<img src="images/3d modelling/assetblockout.PNG">
	<img src="images/3d modelling/assetsilhouette.PNG">
	<p> <b>Blockouts:</b> After playing around with Autodesk Maya and figuring out how to create shapes, I began to work on a blockout. A blockout is the basic shapes of an object, which helps to hone down on the asset and add more detail in the model. </p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<img src="images/3d modelling/shadedwireframe.PNG">
	<p> <b>Wireframe:</b> This is what my goggles looked like after smoothing out the model and adding some flat colour to it. The screenshot also shows the wireframe of the model, which is the blue lines you can see. The wireframe is kind of like the bones of the model. </p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<img src="images/3d modelling/goggleUV.PNG">
	<p> <b>UV Unwrapping:</b> Texturing the asset was admittedly the most challenging part of this task. I had to find a nice leather texture that I thought would suit the goggles, and then put the UV wrapping of the model in the right positions for the texture to go over it. </p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<img src="images/3d modelling/gogglesFINAL.PNG">
	<p> <b>Final Asset:</b> This is my final asset! A pair of steampunk goggles fully modelled and textured! </p>

	<h><b>3D GAME ENVIRONMENT</b></h>
	<p>After the asset design, the next 3D modelling task was to create 3 assets as well as a 3D game environment which the assets would be in. This task, much like the last, had a lot of freedom when it came to ideas. I was greatly inspired by an original character design I had come up with a few weeks prior, and decided to be making a room for that character. </p>

	<img src="images/3d modelling/environmentreference2.PNG">
	<img src="images/3d modelling/environmentreference3.PNG">
	<p><b>Inspiration/References:</b> I gathered and annotated a group of images from games as well as illustrations done by artists online. Using these as inspiration lead to me deciding on the style of my assets and what assets I actually wanted to create.</p>
	<br>

	<img src="images/3d modelling/deskthumbnail.PNG">
	<img src="images/3d modelling/bedthumbnail.PNG">
	<img src="images/3d modelling/bookthumbnail.PNG">
	<p><b>Asset Concept Sketches:</b> These are basic sketches of the three assets I chose to do; a desk, a bed, and a spell book. My idea for these assets is that they belong to a girl who studies magic in a fantasy world. I also liked that these assets weren't overly detailed and seemed quite simple to make shape-wise.</p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<img src="images/3d modelling/finalsketch.PNG">
	<p><b>Final Room Concept:</b> This is 3D perspective drawing of the room I planned on creating. This didn't need to be perfect, so I refined the sketch and added colour so that it would help me to plan out my room when it came to setting it up in Unreal Engine.</p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<img src="images/3d modelling/UE4.PNG" style="height:260px;">
	<p><b>Unreal Engine Room Blockout:</b> This helped me to position everything in the room correctly and get a better idea of the location, size, and the shapes of the assets I wanted to create.</p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>

		<img src="images/3d modelling/bedblockout.PNG">
		<img src="images/3d modelling/bookblockout.PNG">
	<p><b>Asset Blockouts:</b> After the room blockout, I made blockouts of my assets. The good thing about my assets is that they don't change too much from the blockouts because of their basic shapes.</p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<img src="images/3d modelling/deskblockout2.PNG">
	<img src="images/3d modelling/bedblockout2.PNG">
	<img src="images/3d modelling/bookblockout2.PNG">
	<p><b>Second Asset Blockouts:</b> These are just refined versions of the blockouts. Essentially are my assets without any UV unrwapping done.</p>
	<br>

	<img src="images/3d modelling/deskfinal.PNG">
	<img src="images/3d modelling/bedfinal.PNG">
	<img src="images/3d modelling/bookfinal.PNG">
	<p><b>Final Assets:</b> These are the final assets! I didn't have too many textures for each asset, I think at most two for each, which made the texturing process much faster and allowed me more time to put my assets together into my Unreal Engine environment.</p>
	<br>
	<p> <!> </p>
	<img src="images/3d modelling/environment2.PNG" style="height:170px;">
	<img src="images/3d modelling/environment3.PNG" style="height:170px;">
	<p><b>Final Environment:</b> Put all my assets into the Unreal Engine environment, add the textures to the walls and ground, add some lighting and... voila! A final game environment!  </p>
